We studied the version control system.  During the work, it was necessary to create a basic configuration for working with git. Namely 1. Create an SSH key. 2. Create a PGP key. 3. Set up git signatures. 4. Register on Github. 5. Create a local directory for completing assignments on the subject.

## Results

I have successfully completed this task.


With this open format, can even edit your mindmaps in other popular tools such as Obsidian.

Simply insert a Markdown code block labelled as `markmap` and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.

Mindmaps can be created by simply writing the items as a Markdown list within the `markmap` code block, indenting each item to create as many sub-levels as you need:

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```
</code>
</pre>
</div>

renders as

```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```

Anh here's a more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:

```

## Highlighting

<mark>Highlight</mark> important text with `mark`:

```html
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
```

## Callouts

Use [callouts](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/#callouts) (aka _asides_, _hints_, or _alerts_) to draw attention to notes, tips, and warnings.

By wrapping a paragraph in `{{%/* callout note */%}} ... {{%/* /callout */%}}`, it will render as an aside.

```markdown
{{%/* callout note */%}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{%/* /callout */%}}
```

renders as

{{% callout note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

Or use the `warning` callout type so your readers don't miss critical details:

{{% callout warning %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}
